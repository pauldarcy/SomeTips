General Coding Tips
Follow Consistent Naming Conventions – Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and files (e.g., camelCase for JavaScript, snake_case for Python).
Write Modular Code – Break down large functions into smaller, reusable components to improve readability and maintainability.
Document Your Code – Add meaningful comments and docstrings for functions, classes, and modules to help others understand your logic.
Handle Errors Gracefully – Use try-except (Python) or try-catch (JavaScript) blocks to prevent unexpected crashes.
Optimize Performance – Avoid redundant loops, minimize API calls, and use efficient data structures like sets or dictionaries for quick lookups.
Git & GitHub Best Practices
Use Meaningful Commit Messages – Instead of Update index.js, write Fix bug in user authentication.
Follow a Branching Strategy – Use main or develop branches for stable code and feature branches (feature/new-ui) for new work.
Write a Good README – Explain the project, installation steps, usage, and contribution guidelines clearly.
Use .gitignore Properly – Exclude unnecessary files like node_modules, .env, and compiled binaries.
Leverage GitHub Issues & PRs – Assign tasks, discuss bugs, and review changes before merging to maintain quality.
Testing & Code Quality
Write Unit Tests – Use testing frameworks like pytest (Python) or Jest (JavaScript) to ensure functionality.
Automate Code Formatting – Use linters (ESLint, Pylint) and formatters (Prettier, Black) for consistency.
Set Up CI/CD – Automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions or Travis CI.
Refactor Code Regularly – Improve structure and remove duplicate code to keep it clean.
